# Back to Life

Back to Life is a brand new, first-of-its-kind digital in-real-life board game.

It combines the awesomeness of real-life interaction of physical games with the simplicity and computing power of digital devices, creating a unique gaming experience that is engaging, social, has strategic depth... and is easy to get started with.

## Game play

Back to Life is played as a table-top game with physical models representing digital characters, where each character is stored and maintained on a digital device. Each player brings a device of their choice, an iPad, laptop, smartphone, whichever, and on it he or she creates a team consisting of five characters with the abilities and characteristics of that player's chosing. The player then chooses physical models representing each of these digital characters. The model can be anything – a chess piece, a Warhammer figure, figures from Monopoly — even stones if you have nothing else. Most commonly, however, Back to Life is played with Lego figures equipped with swords, helmets, armor, etc, matching that of the character they're respresenting.

In Back to Life, players take turn to move their characters and perform abilities. The abilities range from walking, running & hiding to attacking, defending & fleeing. In Back to Life: Medival, the first Back to Life edition, characters may also learn magic and throw fireballs, teleport, heal, and many other interesting spells. 

Once an ability is performed and the corresponding ability button has been pressed on the device, the player performs the ability by moving the physical model accordingly, if needed. The digital component of the game keeps track of the stats, attributes and characteristics of each team's characters but does not know anything about the setup of battlefield or where on the table each character is located. Just like in a traditional board game, it is up to each player to move only as many steps are they're allowed to, to attack only opponents who are within physical range of their characters, and adhere to all other rules of the game.

To play Back to Life, you need two or more players with a digital device each, two standard dice (d6), a ruler, a physical model for each character in the game and lastly a table with some stuff on it so serve as a Battlefield. (If you enjoy building Lego castles and battle scenes, now is the time.)

## An open-source platform

More than just a game, Back to Life is built as an open-source platform for building digital, real-life board games, where the first game we're building is called Back to Life: Medival. However, being a platform, Back to Life is simple to customize to develop unique mods of the game that are set in other eras, with other abilities, rules and characters, while maintaining the boundaries and unique game play of Back to Life.

This early prototype of Back to Life is built with the excellent web framework MeteorJS and is focused on exploring various modes of the game play. A dedicated Back to Life website will be announced once a higher level of game play flow has been achieved, so that you can get started without knowing how to code. To contribute, check out the issues list. To run Back to Life locally, install Meteor, fork or clone this repository (and remember to `git submodule update --init`) and ask @littke for a recent database dump.
