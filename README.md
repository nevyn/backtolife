# Back to Life

Back to Life is a brand new, first-of-its-kind digital in-real-life board game.

It combines the awesomeness of real-life interaction of physical games with the simplicity and computing power of digital devices, creating a unique gaming experience that is engaging, social, has strategic depth... and is easy to get started with.

## Game play

Back to Life is played as a table-top game with physical models representing digital characters, where each character is stored and maintained on a digital device. Each player brings a device of their choice, an iPad, laptop, smartphone, whichever, and on it he or she creates a team consisting of five characters with the abilities and characteristics of that player's chosing. The player then chooses physical models representing each of these digital characters. The model can be anything – a chess piece, a Warhammer figure, figures from Monopoly — even stones if you have nothing else. Most commonly, however, Back to Life is played with Lego figures equipped with swords, helmets, armor, etc, matching that of the character they're respresenting.

In Back to Life, players take turn to move their characters and perform abilities. The abilities range from moving, running and hiding to attacking, defending and fleeing. In Back to Life: Medival, the first Back to Life edition, characters may also learn magic and throw fireballs, teleport, heal, and many other interesting spells. The game is controlled exclusively from the digital devices and does not know anything about the physical battlefield or where on the field each character is. Just like in traditional board game, it is up to each player to move only as many steps are they're allowed to, only to attack opponents who are within physical range of their characters, and adhere to all other rules of the game.

To play Back to Life, you need at least two players, two standard dice (d6), a ruler, five character game pieces (models) per player, and a battlefield (normally a table but can be anything).

## An open-source platform

More than just a game, Back to Life is built as an open-source platform for building digital, real-life board games, where the first game we're building is called Back to Life: Medival. However, being a platform, Back to Life is simple to customize to develop unique mods of the game that are set in other eras, with other abilities, rules and characters, while maintaining the boundaries and unique game play of Back to Life.

This early prototype of Back to Life is built with the excellent web framework MeteorJS and is focused on exploring various modes of the game play. To contribute, check out the issues list. To run Back to Life locally, install Meteor, clone this repository, and get started.
